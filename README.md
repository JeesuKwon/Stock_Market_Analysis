## Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Instruction
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following imag

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once

## Structure for Coding
* Iteration for All of Worksheets
* Declaration of Variables
* Setting up the Headers for tables
* 'For Loops' for calculating Yearly change / Percent Change / Total Stock Volume by Tickers
  'If Conditions' for finding accurate values
* 'For Loops' for Summary tables
  'If Conditions' for Values
* Formats for numbers, color interiors
